//the game should be over before you start the game
//correct thing to do would be to throw an exception
// start playing with at least two players
//declare explicitly overriding with different exception
//whatever changes you make to HW02 then document it and remember why you made those changes
//technically better to extend, now change the model, better avoiding casting
//protected method where you are creating players objects and then in the whist model override so that instead of
//creating player objects it creates whistplayer object, only the model class knows what is in the player is whistplayer
//has all the methods and functionality of a regular player....this is the normal way
//getter and a setter? for this problem and make this protected so model can access it



//WHAT HAS CHANGED:
//I MADE GETTER AND SETTER METHODS IN THE GENERICSTANDARDCARDGAME class


//who wins the trick if it ends?

//TODO make it so that start play isnt called in the constructor

//TODO isGameOVer exception and play exception

//TODO not always first player who starts the game

//TODO check if a player has cards

//the game cannot end in the middle of a trick
//all changes -- I changed the player class and added two methods remove() and add()
//write in comments that changes
